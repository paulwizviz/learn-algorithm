# Linear Data Structure

In this structure, each element (node) in a linked list is connected sequentially to the next element, forming a straight line-like sequence.

## Linked List

Types of linked list:

* Singly Linked List.
* Double Linked List.
* Circular Linked List.

Here are [working examples](../internal/linkedlist/) demonstrating techniques implementing linked lists. In the working example, you'll see different ways of implementing the data structure.
