# Overview

This project contains references to working examples and references to educational materials about algorithm and data structures.

The key differences between algorithm and data structure are as follows:

| Feature | Data Structure Design | Algorithm Design |
|---|---|---|
| Primary Goal | Organize and store data | Solve a problem or perform a task |
| Focus | Representation and storage of data | Step-by-step procedure |
| Key Concerns | Efficiency of access and manipulation | Logic, efficiency, and correctness |
