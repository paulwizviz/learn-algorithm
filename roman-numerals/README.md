# Roman numerals

Roman numerals have *seven* symbols:

| Symbol | Value |
| -- | -- |
|  I | 1    |
|  V | 5    |
|  X | 10   |
|  L | 50   |
|  C | 100  |
|  D | 500  |
|  M | 1000 |

The value of a sequence of numerals is calculated by adding or subtracting numeric value as you read the characters from left to right. When you have read a numeral that is smaller or equal to the next one you add to the accumulated sum. When the next numeral is smaller than the previous numeral, you deduct from the accumulated sum.
